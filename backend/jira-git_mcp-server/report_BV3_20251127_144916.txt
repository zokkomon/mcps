 TICKET DETAILS:

   [BV3-1] Changes (22/09)
     Jira Status: To Do | Type: Unknown
     Analysis: LIKELY_DONE (Confidence: 70%)
     Reasoning: Several commits update JSX components and JavaScript files within the BlueValley_Conversational_AI_Demo repository. While none of the commits explicitly mention 'BV3-1' or '22/09', the updates to components like 'GoyalHeader.jsx', 'Bluevalley.jsx', 'LocationFilter.jsx', 'Gallery.jsx', and 'useElevenLabsWidget.js' suggest active development and changes related to the project. The commit 'Update convai-tools.js' also indicates relevant work. Given the assignee is '22/09', it's likely these commits are related to the ticket, but without explicit confirmation, the status is 'LIKELY_DONE'.
